# Introduction

 After the closure of Black Mesa One, the first headquarters of the Black Mesa Corporation, four new facilities were built around the western United States. These facilities include Black Mesa North, South, East and West. All of these locations specialize in a particular function of the Black Mesa research machine.

# Black Mesa West
!!! quote "Quote from the Memoirs of Administrator Breen 'Bridging Worlds: My Life and Science' Ch.4"
    There was something intoxicating about it all. I will admit now, in hindsight, that I was charmed not only by the practicalities of the site but by the symbolism. We were, in a sense, inheriting the mantle of Silicon Valley’s pioneers—taking over where one industry had faltered, and reshaping it to serve a higher purpose. We were physicists, yes, but no less entrepreneurs. We wanted to believe we were cut from the same cloth as the entrepreneurs and visionaries who had transformed garages into global enterprises. Why shouldn’t physicists, too, claim that mantle?

Black Mesa West was founded in the late 70's by (at that time) a new and budding Black Mesa Corproation. Having received millions in government contracts and the sale of their previous headquarters to an ambitious land developer, Black Mesa chose to buy a shuttered microchip factory in the Port of San Francisco. The company that had been there before moved to China, amidst the country's march into the modern age.
