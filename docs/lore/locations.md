# Introduction

 After the closure of Black Mesa One, the first headquarters of the Black Mesa Corporation, four new facilities were built around the western United States. These facilities include Black Mesa North, South, East and West. All of these locations specialize in a particular function of the Black Mesa research machine.

# Black Mesa West
!!! quote "Quote from the Memoirs of Administrator Breen 'The Right Man in the Right Place.' Ch.4"
    Ever since we bought the ranch at Black Mesa One, the name of a single city was in our collective minds, I guess you could say. That was San Francisco, the 'city on the hill.' A lot of us had been on the East Coast most of our lives, in the wet, gray, and generally squalid aesthetics. San Francisco would be something new for us, a career formed in the Golden State, like many other successful businessmen and scientists did before us. I remember how we actually found a property to purchase for means of setting up a new headquarters: my accountant had actually been on the lookout for quite some time for good, large office properties. We got very lucky, we bought out an old microchip factory that had gone out of business. A large, industrial facility with warehouses and offices! What was not to love?
