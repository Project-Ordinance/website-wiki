#Black Mesa East#
Black Mesa East is the "pride and joy" of the Black Mesa Corporation. Considered by some as the "largest building on Earth", Black Mesa East has too many sectors, zones, and areas to truly describe here. Black Mesa East is managed by the Black Mesa Corporation administrator, Wallace Breen. The facility is built in to the Grand Canyon and distantly related plateaus which are located nearby. Due to the intense heat on the surface, the majority of the facility is located underground.

#Black Mesa West#
Managed by the Black Mesa Executive Board, Black Mesa West functions as the primary bureaucratic, financial, and policy nerve center for the Black Mesa Corporation. Originally, the Black Mesa West campus was one several small basement rooms under a telecommunications building, but went under significant renovation in 1989 through 1994. Located in the San Francisco bay area, the main Black Mesa West campus exists above and below ground; with most executive functions occuring in the subterranian sections. 

Despite the public-facing reputation of this location, a majority of what actually occurs in this building are extremely classified.

#Black Mesa South#
Black Mesa South is a secondary location managed externally by the United States Department of Energy alongside on-site engineering personnel. Consisting of thousands of servers, Black mesa South manages and records data flows from every single Black Mesa location; forming the Black Mesa Network. Originally built inside of a cold-war telecommunications bunker, the facility consists of three tempreture controlled sectors buried in a classified location outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The facility is engineered to survive EMPs, floods, sabotage, and potentially nuclear exchange, South’s archival rooms are lined in feet of reinforced concrete and steel honeycomb plating. Everything from the mundane to the most sensitive passes through this site. Popular rumors dictate that there is a secretive "black vault" within the pre-existing complex, which is said to store the remains of the roswell aliens; or hold alien communication devices. The Black Mesa Corporation dismisses these rumors.

#Black Mesa North#
The North branch was designed as Black Mesa’s most cutting-edge and inwardly restrictive research institute. Built in the rocky mountain ranges outside of Denver, it operates under the cover of snowstorms and deep evergreen forests while conducting ambitious, controversial, and often dangerous scientific trials. Black Mesa North specialized in early-phase experimental concepts—projects too unstable for the central facility but too promising to discard. Work conducted here is classified. Many prototypes that later reached full development in New Mexico were first conceived and tested in North’s high-altitude chambers.
