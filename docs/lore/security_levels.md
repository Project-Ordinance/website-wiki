#Level One Clearance#
Level one clearance is the lowest possible obtainable clearance at the Black Mesa Research Facility. This clearance is typically given to visitors, guests and dignitaries, tourists, and interns. The Level One security clearance grants the most minimal access to facility grounds, mainly allowing access to classrooms, lecture halls, museums, gift shops, and all other above-ground secondary income attractions. Those with this clearance are not allowed in any subterranian areas of the facility.
