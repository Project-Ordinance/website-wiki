Black Mesa is partnered with a variety of U.S Government organizations.

##Department of Energy##
The Department of Energy is one of the primary regulating bodies for energy usage within the United States. The Department of Energy is one of Black Mesa's oldest partners, and the two organizations frequently work together on energy research projects. Having been in the department's good graces for quite some time, Black Mesa holds a unique competeive advantage, as it holds exclusive permits to operate hydro-electric dams, with Department of Energy supervision. 

##DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)#
DARPA is one of Black Mesa's military research partners. Many projects which exceed the scope of DARPA's funding are handed to Black Mesa, and vice versa with projects deemed too small for Black Mesa's attention. The relationship between DARPA and Black Mesa has been described as "purely transactional."

##National Science Foundation (NSF)#
The NSF is one of the many grant providers for Black Mesa. With a sizable seat in Black Mesa's ethics department, the NSF seeks to regulate Black Mesa using funds as leverage. Many of Black Mesa's scientific proposals have gone through the NSF.

##NASA##
NASA is by far the most recognizable partner which Black Mesa has. NASA and Black Mesa work together on all space and aeronautics based research projects, and frequently loan equipment from eachother. Many of Black Mesa's rockets and satellites have been designed by or purchased from NASA's own facilities.

##Center for Disease Control##
The CDC is one of the lesser partners of Black Mesa. While medicinal study is typically not the focus of Black Mesa, many researchers in various Black Mesa sites do pursue research in the field of medicine. During times of dire medical need in the United States or internationally, Black Mesa typically is one of the first institutions to send their best. 

#Military Partnerships#
Black Mesa is partnered with a variety of U.S Military organizations and departments.

##United States Miliary##
Much of the money that flows in to Black Mesa's accounts is from the United States Military. The Black Mesa Corporation, alongside hundreds like it, all compete for military contracts. The relationship between Black Mesa and the United States Military, by extension the United States Government, is constantly in a state of ebb and flow. Depending on the administration, Black Mesa's funds can skyrocket and public support balloon, or face serious loss of funds and resentment. 

##Air Force Research Laboratory##
Black Mesa purchases specialized components from the Air Force Research Laboratory for their own airel tests. Much of the Air Force Research Laboratory's hangars and runaways are approved for usage by Black Mesa scientists. The Air Force Research Laboratory frequently sends their own researchers to Black Mesa and vice versa, to work together on various projects.

##NEST (Nuclear Emergency Support Team)##
The Nuclear Emergency Support Team, or just NEST, is one of the primary advising bodies for Black Mesa's nuclear projects. Black Mesa is currently in a contract for support in the case of a nuclear emergency with NEST, but information on when this contract expires is classified.

#Private Sector Partnerships and Investors#
Black Mesa wouldn't be Black Mesa without the help of our partnerships and investors.

##Lockheed Martin##
Lockheed Martin purchases, loans, and sells equipment to Black Mesa. Without them, our aerospace defense projects would be impossible. 

##Northrop Grumman##
Northtrop Grumman currently invests in Black Mesa, and has been selling and purchasing specialized components frequently. 

##Boeing##
Boeing currently invests heavily in Black Mesa, and we are currently engaged in a deep partnership with them. The Boeing corporation allows Black Mesa to utilize their test runways and hangars, and Black Mesa supplies Boeing with a steady stock of monitoring equipment and loaned personnel.
