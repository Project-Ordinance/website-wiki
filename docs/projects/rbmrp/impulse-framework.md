# Introduction to the impulse Framework

This page introduces the **impulse framework** used on the rBMRP server. It is aimed at players who may be familiar with other Garry’s Mod roleplay gamemodes such as DarkRP and need a clear overview of how impulse works and what to expect.

---

## What is impulse?

Impulse is a roleplay-focused framework designed around:

* Structured roles and departments
* XP-based progression
* Immersion and in-world interaction
* Support for systems like PAC3 and Wiremod (with rules)

Unlike economy-driven gamemodes, impulse emphasizes **roleplay stability** rather than constant job switching or money grinding.

!!! info
    If you are used to DarkRP’s F4 job menu and fast swapping of roles, impulse will feel more deliberate and progression-based.

## Key Differences from DarkRP

* **No F4 job menu**
    - Jobs are not bought or switched through a simple menu.
    - You select **teams** (departments) and progress within them.

* **XP-based progression**
    - You gain **XP** over time by playing, roleplaying, and taking part in server activities.
    - XP unlocks access to new teams and higher ranks.

* **PAC3 and Wiremod available to all**
    - Cosmetic character customization (PAC3) and in-world contraptions (Wiremod) are allowed.
    - Their use is restricted by server rules to keep performance, balance and lore intact.

* **Roles over money**
    - Money exists, but your **role, rank and XP** matter far more than your cash.
    - You are expected to act according to your position in the facility.

## The Player Menu

Impulse replaces the traditional DarkRP F4 menu with a unified **Player Menu**.
This menu is your main hub for actions, role selection, information, and progression.

The key for opening it may vary (commonly **F1** or **F3**) depending on server configuration.

The Player Menu is divided into several sections:

### Actions

Contains personal actions and utilities provided by the framework or server, such as emotes or small interaction tools.

---

### Teams

The **Teams** section is where you choose your role in the facility.

* Each team represents a department or function (e.g. **Security Division**, **Research & Development**, **Service Personnel**, **Visitor**, etc.).
* Teams can have:
    - **XP requirements**
    - **Player limits**
    - **Lore and responsibility descriptions**

When selecting a team:

1. Available teams are listed in the center of the menu.
2. A detailed description appears on the right, explaining the team’s purpose and expectations.
3. Teams that you cannot currently access (due to XP or restrictions) appear under **Unavailable teams**.

This system encourages players to commit to a role and understand it before moving into higher responsibility positions.

---

### Classes & Ranks

Within the Teams menu there is a tab for **Classes & Ranks**.

This tab shows the internal progression for each team, including:

* **Ranks** (e.g. *Office Coordinator*, *Department Manager*, *Executive Officer*, *Administrator* for Administrative Department)
* **Classes** where applicable (for example, HECU uses classes like *Rifleman*, *Medic*, *Shotgunner*, *Engineer*)
* **XP requirements** for each rank or class
* Short descriptions of responsibility and intended roleplay

Progression is **earned**, not purchased.
You gain XP through play, then unlock promotions or new positions over time.

!!! note
    High-level roles are intentionally gated behind XP and sometimes whitelist requirements to ensure players understand the framework and setting before occupying important positions.

---

### Business

The **Business** section is used differently from server to server.
On rBMRP, it may be minimal or disabled, and is not the primary way to progress or obtain gear.

---

### Information

The **Information** section provides:

* Local guides
* System explanations
* Server rules or notes

New players should check this area for any server-specific instructions or overviews.

---

## HUD Overview

The default HUD (bottom left) shows:

* **Health**
* **Hunger**
* **Money**
* **XP**
* Your character name and current team

Hunger and survival elements exist, but again, **XP and role** are the focus for long-term progression.

---

## PAC3 Usage

PAC3 is enabled for all players, but subject to rules.

General expectations:

* Customizations must remain **setting-appropriate** and **lore friendly**.
* No meme models, non-universe characters, or immersion-breaking outfits.
* No oversized, invisible, or hitbox-breaking PACs.
* Avoid excessive glowing, particle spam, or heavy performance impact.

Staff may revoke PAC privileges if it is abused.

---

## Wiremod Usage

Wiremod is also available to players on rBMRP.

Allowed examples:

* Simple RP machinery (displays, sensors, small utility devices)
* Environmental or informational contraptions that support roleplay

Not allowed:

* Lag machines or performance-heavy contraptions
* Automated combat systems or weapon rigs
* Prop spam, exploitative constructions, or anything that harms gameplay

Wiremod is there to support the environment and RP, not to dominate it.

---

## Progression and XP

XP (Experience Points) is a core part of the impulse framework’s progression system. As you play, you accumulate XP which unlocks new teams and higher ranks.

### How you gain XP

Typical sources of XP include:

* Time spent playing
* Roleplay participation
* Helping your department fulfill its responsibilities
* Interacting with systems and taking part in events

(The exact rates and methods can be adjusted by the server.)

### What XP does

XP is used to:

* Unlock access to more advanced **teams**
* Progress through **ranks** or **classes** inside a team
* Demonstrate experience and commitment to your role

XP does **not** directly grant weapons, items, or paychecks; it reflects your character’s growth and trust within the framework.

## Common Misconceptions for DarkRP Players

* **“Where is the F4 job menu?”**
    - Impulse uses the Player Menu and team selection, not job purchases.

* **“Why can’t I instantly switch to a high-rank role?”**
    - Roles are tied to XP and sometimes whitelists for stability and quality.

* **“Is this just DarkRP with different names?”**
    - No. Jobs are departments with persistent responsibilities, not income sources.

* **“Can I use PAC3 for anything?”**
    - Only within lore, performance, and visual rules.

* **“Is money the main goal?”**
    - No. Your role, progression, and participation matter far more than cash.
