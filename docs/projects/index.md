# Projects

This section highlights the three main Project Ordinance initiatives.

- [Main Server](main-server.md) — The flagship experience. A large, long‑term effort that ties together core systems, content, and live operations.
- [Escape](escape.md) — A gamemode inspired by SCP: Secret Laboratory, focused on tense escapes, asymmetrical roles, and emergent chaos.
- [Deathmatch](deathmatch.md) — A fast‑paced mode inspired by Black Mesa’s Deathmatch, with tight arenas and rapid respawns.
- [rBMRP](rbmrp/index.md) — A temporary roleplay server set in the Black Mesa universe, capturing the spirit of classic Half-Life RP communities.

> Pages below will expand with roadmaps, design notes, and changelogs as development progresses.
