# R.B.M.R.P.

The **R.B.M.R.P. (Black Mesa Roleplay)** server **launched on November 28th, 2025**, marking the beginning of the official community and crucial testing environment for Project Ordinance. This server **runs** continuously, operating as the essential bridge during our final development period until the monumental launch of the live **Project Ordinance** Main Server.

The rBMRP phase **serves** as the indispensable, fully playable experience that community members use **while** the sophisticated core systems, detailed custom map geometry, and comprehensive lore framework for Project Ordinance **are being completed**. Its operational purpose **will conclude** upon the subsequent Main Server launch, paving the way for the full Serious RP experience.

## 1. Purpose and Legacy

The primary, non-negotiable function of the rBMRP server **is** to provide a consistent and enjoyable playable experience for the community while simultaneously providing critical stress-testing and data validation for the final project. It **operates** diligently to keep players engaged and offers invaluable, real-world feedback that is actively incorporated **leading up to** the Project Ordinance launch. Every interaction, every system usage, and every bug report directly contributes to the stability and balance of the final product.

* **Launch Date of rBMRP Server:** November 28th, 2025.

* **Operational Period:** Pre-launch development (from Nov 28, 2025, until Main Server launch).

* **Legacy Role:** Pre-Launch Experience / System Validation and QA.

* **Focus:** Semi-Serious Roleplay (Semi-SRP) and Community Retention.

## 2. Server Environment and Atmosphere (Current)

During its operational period, the rBMRP server **maintains** a structured but flexible **Semi-Serious** level of roleplay. This atmosphere intentionally encourages dynamic, often unexpected, character interaction and allows for creative, high-energy scenarios that might not fit the rigorous Serious RP criteria of the final server. It serves as a functional, highly enjoyable sandbox space while the sophisticated, lore-accurate Serious RP focus **is developed** for the Main Server. Players are encouraged to explore their character ideas and build community bonds without the strict regulatory framework that will define the Main Server.

## 3. Community Inspiration and Design

The design philosophy behind the rBMRP server **is** deeply rooted in the rich and often nostalgic history of the wider BMRP community. It **is designed** to capture a comprehensive, yet immediately accessible, experience for players awaiting the new project:

* **Nostalgic Freedom:** rBMRP captures the dynamic, player-driven narrative and highly engaging sandbox feel often celebrated in influential early BMRP servers like **cBMRP** and **Box BMRP**. This ensures immediate engagement and high creative output from the community.

* **Mechanical Depth:** This freedom **is built** upon a solid and stable technical foundation, providing a sense of mechanical integrity and system robustness similar to later structured servers like **pBMRP**. This design choice ensures a smooth, intuitive transition to the advanced, complex systems of Project Ordinance.

* **The Synthesis:** The result **is** the ideal pre-launch sandbox. It allows for the classic Black Mesa scenarios to unfold naturally on a system that efficiently **prepares** the community for the full, immersive, and interconnected Project Ordinance ecosystem.

## 4. Required Content (Current)

The single required collection for the rBMRP server **is required for immediate play**. This consolidated collection simplifies the joining process during the development phase. This collection **will be superseded** by the separate, full **Client** and **Server** collections necessary for the live **Project Ordinance** servers upon their official launch.

* **rBMRP Workshop Collection (Active):**

## 5. Transition to Project Ordinance

The rBMRP server **will successfully complete** its objective and **will be superseded** by the live **Project Ordinance** ecosystem, which **will become** the definitive and permanent Black Mesa experience:

* **The Main Server:** The core facility simulation, integrating all departmental duties and integrated surface environments into one persistent narrative.

* **The Xen Server:** A dedicated field operations server for Survey Teams and specialized research personnel.

Thank you for your active participation and invaluable contributions to the rBMRP phase as we work tirelessly toward the full launch of Project Ordinance.
